# is-even
a collection of stupid way to find if a number is even (inspired by r/ProgrammerHumor)<br>
(please do not PM me to say some function are not working, i know)

# feel free to contribute !

## how?
- find a stupid and/or funny way to find if a number is even
- check if your function is not already mentioned (see below)
- implement it in Python 3 with a docstring comment
- make a pull request (precise if you want to be credited and how)

## what i considere "already mentioned"
function that are slight variante of already existing ones<br>
for exemple :

```py
# already indide
def isEven(n):
    # something
    return expression
```
your PR:
```py
def isEven(n):
    # the same something
    if expression:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```
<br>other exemple:
```py
# already inside
def isEven(n):
    # something
    if a in (b, c, d, ...)
        ...
```
your PR:
```py
# already inside
def isEven(n):
    # the same something
    if a == b or a == c or a == d or ...
        ...
```
